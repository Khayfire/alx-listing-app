# ALX Listing App

## 📌 Project Overview
The **ALX Listing App** is an Airbnb clone project focused on building a property listing platform.  
The main goal is to create a responsive, well-structured, and maintainable codebase using **Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint**.  

This milestone establishes the **scaffold and foundation** for the project, setting up reusable components, a clean folder structure, and static assets.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
Here’s a breakdown of the key directories and their purpose:

alx-listing-app/
├── components/ # Reusable UI components
│ └── common/ # Shared components (Card, Button, etc.)
├── interfaces/ # TypeScript interfaces (props, models, etc.)
├── constants/ # Reusable constants (API URLs, UI text, config)
├── public/ # Static files served directly
│ └── assets/ # Images, SVGs, and other assets
└── styles/ # Global and component-specific styles


---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js (Pages Router)** – React framework for building web apps  
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and maintainable code  
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first styling  
- **ESLint** – Code linting and formatting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-listing-app.git
cd alx-listing-app








This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
